# Transpiling ES6+ to ES5 for Goja

## Overview
This document outlines strategies for transpiling modern ES6+ JavaScript to ES5, making it compatible with the Goja JavaScript engine used in the Dougless Runtime.

## Options for Transpilation

### Option 1: esbuild
- **Description**: A fast JavaScript bundler and minifier.
- **Go Bindings**: Available at `github.com/evanw/esbuild/pkg/api`.
- **Benefits**: 
  - Native Go integration, aligns well with Goja
  - Extremely fast and efficient, suitable for both development and production
  - Specify output target using `--target=es5`
- **Use Case**: On-the-fly transpilation or pre-build processing.

### Option 2: Babel
- **Description**: A comprehensive JavaScript compiler with rich plugin ecosystem.
- **Integration**: Via CLI as a Node.js subprocess.
- **Benefits**:
  - Maximum compatibility with modern JavaScript features
  - Ability to utilize Babel plugins for customization
- **Considerations**: Heavier than Go-native options; performance overhead might be higher.

### Option 3: SWC
- **Description**: A super-fast JavaScript/TypeScript compiler written in Rust.
- **Bindings**: Experimental Go bindings available.
- **Benefits**: Faster than Babel with comparable feature support.
- **Use Case**: Potential alternative if performance is a strict requirement.

### Option 4: TypeScript Compiler
- **Description**: Commonly used TypeScript-to-JS compiler also capable of JavaScript transpilation.
- **Integration**: Use `tsc --target ES5` to compile.
- **Benefits**:
  - Supports TypeScript directly; handles modern JavaScript as well
  - Can be integrated for projects needing TS support

## Suggested Strategy
- **Employ esbuild** as the primary transpiler due to its speed and native Go integration.
- Consider caching transpiled outputs to optimize performance further.
- Reserve Babel for cases requiring extensive feature compatibility or plugin usage.

## Implementation Approaches
- **On-the-fly Transpilation**: Detect and transpile scripts at runtime.
- **Build-time Processing**: Transpile JavaScript files during build or development phases.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Cache transpiled files and regenerate them upon source changes.

## Conclusion
By implementing a transpilation strategy, Dougless Runtime can robustly support modern JavaScript syntax while maintaining performance integrity. This flexibility ensures compatibility with modern development practices without compromising the efficiency of the Goja engine.
