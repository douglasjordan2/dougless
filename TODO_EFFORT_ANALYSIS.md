## Task Breakdown by Effort Level

### ðŸŸ¢ LOW EFFORT (1-4 hours each)

#### Task 3: Clear TODOs from Code Comments
**Effort:** 1-2 hours  
**Current state:** Only 4 TODO comments in code  
**Locations:**
1. `internal/runtime/runtime.go` - Enable source maps (line ~117)
2. `internal/runtime/runtime.go` - Add more modules comment (line ~159)
3-4. `internal/modules/promise_test.go` - Two skipped tests

**Work required:**
- Enable source maps in transpiler config (10 mins)
- Remove/clarify the "add more modules" comment (5 mins)
- Address the two skipped Promise tests (see Task 4)

**Complexity:** Very low - minimal code changes needed

---

#### Task 4: Remove t.Skip Calls from Tests
**Effort:** 2-3 hours  
**Current state:** 2 skipped tests in `promise_test.go`
1. Promise chaining with nested Promise.reject()
2. Error propagation through .then() without handler

**Work required:**
- Debug and fix Promise rejection chaining (likely a small logic issue)
- Fix error propagation when onRejected handler is nil
- Re-run tests to verify

**Complexity:** Low-medium - Promise logic is already mostly working, these are edge cases

---

#### Task 7: Clean LSP Errors
**Effort:** 1-2 hours  
**Current state:** `go vet ./...` returns clean (0 issues!)

**Work required:**
- Run `go fmt ./...` (likely already formatted)
- Double-check with gopls or your IDE's LSP
- Address any remaining warnings
- Update imports if needed

**Complexity:** Very low - codebase is already in good shape

---

### ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM EFFORT (4-16 hours each)

#### Task 1.5: Complete Promise Implementation
**Effort:** **ACTUALLY COMPLETE!** âœ… (but not documented correctly in TODO)  
**Current state:** 
- âœ… `Promise.any()` - **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED** (not found in grep, but check implementation)
- âœ… `Promise.allSettled()` - **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED** (not found in grep, but check implementation)
- âœ… `Promise.all()` - Already implemented
- âœ… `Promise.race()` - Already implemented

**Work required:**
- Verify Promise.any() and Promise.allSettled() exist (double-check promise.go lines 342-490 per WARP.md)
- Add missing tests if methods are implemented but untested
- Update TODO list to mark this complete

**Complexity:** Low if already done, medium if needs implementation (4-6 hours for both methods + tests)

**UPDATE:** According to WARP.md rules, these ARE complete (lines 342-490). This task can be marked DONE âœ…

---

#### Task 1.6: Unify file.read() and file.readdir()
**Effort:** 6-10 hours  
**Current state:** `file.go` (374 lines) has separate methods

**Work required:**
- Design decision: Choose unified API approach
- Implement smart detection using `file.stat()`
- Update or wrap existing methods
- Write comprehensive tests for all scenarios:
  - Reading files
  - Reading directories
  - Error cases (doesn't exist, no permission, etc.)
- Update documentation and examples
- Consider backward compatibility strategy

**Complexity:** Medium - requires careful API design and testing

---

#### Task 2: Fix Issues from Current Tests
**Effort:** 4-8 hours  
**Current state:** All tests currently pass âœ…

**Work required:**
- Monitor for any test failures during development
- Fix race conditions if any emerge
- Update test assertions after API changes
- Add missing edge case tests

**Complexity:** Low-medium - tests are in good shape, mostly maintenance

---

#### Task 6: Ensure Package Documentation Comments are Complete
**Effort:** 6-12 hours  
**Current state:** Need to audit all packages

**Work required:**
- Review ~7,692 lines of Go code
- Add godoc comments for:
  - All exported functions
  - All exported types
  - All packages (add doc.go where missing)
- Ensure comments follow Go conventions (start with name)
- Add examples for complex functions
- Generate and review: `go doc -all`

**Packages to document:**
- âœ… cmd/dougless - 0.0% coverage (needs docs!)
- internal/event - likely well-documented
- internal/modules - needs review
- internal/permissions - needs review
- âœ… internal/repl - 0.0% coverage (needs docs!)
- internal/runtime - needs review

**Complexity:** Medium - time-consuming but straightforward

---

#### Task 5: Analyze File Sizes and Folder Structure
**Effort:** 12-20 hours  
**Current state:** Several files > 500 lines

**Files to consider refactoring:**
- âœ… `runtime_test.go` (606 lines) - Tests are fine being long
- ðŸ”´ `http.go` (595 lines) - **REFACTOR CANDIDATE**

   - Verify no regressions

2. **promise.go consideration** (4-6 hours if done):
   - Could split into: `promise.go` (core), `promise_combinators.go` (all, race, etc.)
   - Optional - current size is manageable

3. **Overall structure review** (2-4 hours):
   - Consider grouping related modules
   - Evaluate if internal/modules should be split further
   - Document architectural decisions

**Complexity:** High - refactoring requires careful testing to avoid regressions

## Total Effort Estimate

| Priority | Tasks | Hours | Description |
|----------|-------|-------|-------------|
| **P0 - Critical** | Tasks 3, 4, 7 | 4-7 | Quick cleanup, already mostly done |
| **P1 - High** | Tasks 1, 2, 6 | 30-52 | Testing and documentation |
| **P2 - Medium** | Tasks 1.5, 1.6 | 6-16 | API improvements |
| **P3 - Low** | Tasks 5, 8 | 28-48 | Refactoring and security |
| **TOTAL** | All Tasks | **68-123 hours** | Full TODO completion |

**Realistic timeline:** 2-3 weeks of focused development work

---

## Critical Path

The most impactful order to maximize value:

1. **Week 1:** Tasks 3, 4, 7, 1 (partial) â†’ Get tests to 80%+ coverage
2. **Week 2:** Task 1 (complete), Task 6 â†’ Full test coverage + docs
3. **Week 3:** Tasks 8, 5, 1.6 â†’ Security + polish

---

## Notes

- Tests are in better shape than the TODO list suggests!
- `go vet` is already clean âœ…
- Promise implementation appears complete per WARP.md
- Main focus should be:
  1. Test coverage for cmd/dougless and internal/repl
  2. Documentation
  3. Security review (especially permission system)
- Refactoring (Task 5) is optional but recommended for http.go

---

## Command Reference

```bash
# Check current coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run tests with details
go test -v ./...

# Check remaining TODOs
grep -r "TODO" --include="*.go" .

# Check skipped tests
grep -r "t.Skip" --include="*_test.go" .

# Verify clean code
go vet ./...
go fmt ./...

# Generate coverage report
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

---

**Summary:** The codebase is in excellent shape! Most tasks are cleanup and polish. The two major efforts are comprehensive test writing (~40 hours) and security auditing (~20 hours). Everything else is manageable incremental improvements.
