# Dougless Runtime

A custom JavaScript runtime built in Go, designed to serve as the foundation for a custom full-stack framework powered by WebSockets. Built with the Goja engine and featuring ES6+ transpilation capabilities.

## Overview

Dougless Runtime is a custom runtime designed with the end goal of serving a custom full-stack framework powered by WebSockets. It's not inherently compatible with everything Node.js supports as it represents a new paradigm. This includes a custom system for building plugins to extend the framework. Built on top of the Goja JavaScript engine, Dougless Runtime provides a clean, maintainable codebase with excellent JavaScript interoperability.

In addition to the Goja engine, we are introducing a build-time tool that will compile ES6+ into ES5, enhancing compatibility and performance.

## Features (Planned)

- 🚀 **High-performance JavaScript execution** using Goja (pure Go)
- 📁 **File I/O operations** with both sync and async APIs
- 🌐 **HTTP client and server** support
- 🔌 **WebSocket** implementation for real-time applications
- ⚡ **Event loop** with proper async operation handling
- 📦 **CommonJS module system** with built-in modules
- 🔒 **Crypto utilities** and security features
- 🛠️ **Process management** and system integration

## Current Status

This project is in early development (Phase 1 - Foundation). Currently implemented:

### Core Infrastructure ✅
- ✅ Basic project structure and Go module setup
- ✅ Core runtime with Goja integration
- ✅ Event loop with proper async operation handling
- ✅ Module registry system with CommonJS-style require()
- ✅ Placeholder implementations for fs, http, and path modules

### Timer System ✅
- ✅ `setTimeout()` - Schedule one-time delayed execution
- ✅ `setInterval()` - Schedule recurring execution
- ✅ `clearTimeout()` - Cancel pending timeouts
- ✅ `clearInterval()` - Cancel active intervals
- ✅ Proper WaitGroup management for graceful shutdown

### Console Operations ✅
- ✅ `console.log()`, `console.error()`, `console.warn()` - Standard output
- ✅ `console.time()` / `console.timeEnd()` - Performance measurement
- ✅ `console.table()` - Structured data visualization with table formatting

### Next Up (Phase 2)
- ⏳ File system operations (fs module)
- ⏳ Path manipulation utilities (path module)
- ⏳ Enhanced error handling with stack traces
- ⏳ Unit and integration tests

## Quick Start
