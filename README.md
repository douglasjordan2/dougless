# Dougless Runtime

A custom JavaScript runtime built in Go, designed to serve as the foundation for a custom full-stack framework powered by WebSockets. Built with the Goja engine and featuring ES6+ transpilation capabilities.

## Overview

Dougless Runtime is a custom runtime designed with the end goal of serving a custom full-stack framework powered by WebSockets. It's not inherently compatible with everything Node.js supports as it represents a new paradigm. This includes a custom system for building plugins to extend the framework. Built on top of the Goja JavaScript engine, Dougless Runtime provides a clean, maintainable codebase with excellent JavaScript interoperability.

In addition to the Goja engine, we are introducing a build-time tool that will compile ES6+ into ES5, enhancing compatibility and performance.

## Features (Planned)

- üöÄ **High-performance JavaScript execution** using Goja (pure Go)
- üìÅ **File I/O operations** with both sync and async APIs
- üåê **HTTP client and server** support
- üîå **WebSocket** implementation for real-time applications
- ‚ö° **Event loop** with proper async operation handling
- üì¶ **CommonJS module system** with built-in modules
- üîí **Crypto utilities** and security features
- üõ†Ô∏è **Process management** and system integration

## Current Status

This project is in early development (Phase 1 - Foundation). Currently implemented:

### Core Infrastructure ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Basic project structure and Go module setup
- ‚úÖ Core runtime with Goja integration
- ‚úÖ Event loop with proper async operation handling
- ‚úÖ Module registry system with CommonJS-style require()
- ‚úÖ Placeholder implementations for fs, http, and path modules

### Timer System ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ `setTimeout()` - Schedule one-time delayed execution
- ‚úÖ `setInterval()` - Schedule recurring execution
- ‚úÖ `clearTimeout()` - Cancel pending timeouts
- ‚úÖ `clearInterval()` - Cancel active intervals
- ‚úÖ Proper WaitGroup management for graceful shutdown

### Console Operations ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ `console.log()`, `console.error()`, `console.warn()` - Standard output
- ‚úÖ `console.time()` / `console.timeEnd()` - Performance measurement
- ‚úÖ `console.table()` - Structured data visualization with table formatting

### Next Up (Phase 2)
- ‚è≥ File system operations (fs module)
- ‚è≥ Path manipulation utilities (path module)
- ‚è≥ Enhanced error handling with stack traces
- ‚è≥ Unit and integration tests
